Graphical issues:
Most 3D games have issues with dark models, some suffer from polygon pop-in or polygon explosions.
Dark models specifically are caused by bad GTE color instructions (NCDS, NCDT, NCCS, CDP, etc.),
should be fixed once I fix these instructions
Polygon pop-in might be related to the timers, or maybe wrong IRQ on GTE instruction handling
I'm pretty sure polygon explosions are caused by my terrible GTE implementation

Silent Hill requires mask bit emulation, otherwise, semi-transparent white boxes appear on top of
models/sprites

Some 2D sprites/textures may have a slight seam on their borders, probably some off-by-one error on
my texture sampling code, I'm actively working on tracking down this issue

A very small set of games have hopelessly broken graphics, Mortal Kombat II was the first commercial
game I was able to boot, with broken graphics, yet after all this time it still stands as the only
game with badly broken graphics for some reason. I have tried a billion fixes, yet nothing seems to
improve the graphics, might come back to this issue some time in the future.
Another example of this is the title screen on "Bubble Bobble also featuring Rainbow Islands", graphics
are completely broken, but thankfully the actual games seem to be unaffected

Sound/music issues:
Some games have broken music, Darius Gaiden seems to fail something and keeps retrying XA playback
sequence goes like: Start XA playback, Getstat, Getstat, GetlocP, retry

Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes "forgets" to start XA playback, this is a regression, the
game used to play music no problem, need to investigate
